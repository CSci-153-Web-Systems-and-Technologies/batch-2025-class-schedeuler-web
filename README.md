## 🗄 Database Schema

The application relies on the following Supabase tables:

| Table Name | Description | Key Columns |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **profiles** | User metadata and roles | `id`, `account_type` ('student'/'instructor'), `notify_prefs` |
| **classes** | Official classes created by instructors | `code`, `schedule_settings`, `repeat_days`, `repeat_until` |
| **enrollments** | Student-Class relationships | `student_id`, `class_id`, `status` ('pending'/'approved'), `conflict_report` |
| **events** | Personal student tasks and subjects | `user_id`, `type` ('task'/'subject'), `start_time`, `end_time` |
| **proposals** | Schedule change proposals | `class_id`, `new_time`, `threshold_percent`, `status` |
| **votes** | Student votes on proposals | `proposal_id`, `student_id`, `vote` (bool) |
| **reports** | Bug reports submitted by users | `category`, `message`, `user_id` |

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js 18+
* A Supabase Project
* A Gmail account (for bug report functionality, requires App Password)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:BinongoIsrael/class-schedeuler.git
    cd schedeuler
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Database Setup:**
    Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to ensure schema compatibility:
    ```sql
    -- Essential columns for the "Repeat Until" feature
    ALTER TABLE classes ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS repeat_until TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NULL;
    ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS repeat_until TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NULL;
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory. You must configure these keys for the app to function correctly.

| Variable Name | Description | Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase Project URL | **Yes** |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Your Supabase Public API Key | **Yes** |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Admin Key for role synchronization (Bypasses RLS) | **Yes** |
| `GMAIL_USER` | Email address for sending bug reports | **Yes** |
| `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` | App Password for the Gmail account above | **Yes** |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Production URL (e.g., `https://schedeuler.vercel.app`) | **Yes** |

> **⚠️ Security Note:** Never commit `.env.local` to version control. The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is highly sensitive and grants full database access.
